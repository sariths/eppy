Eppy Tutorial
=============

Authors: Santosh Philip, Leora Tanjuatco

Eppy is a scripting language for E+ idf files, and E+ output files. Eppy
is written in the programming language Python. As a result it takes full
advantage of the rich data structure and idioms that are avaliable in
python. You can programmatically navigate, search, and modify E+ idf
files using eppy. The power of using a scripting language allows you to
do the following:

-  Make a large number of changes in an idf file with a few lines of
   eppy code.
-  Use conditions and filters when making changes to an idf file
-  Make changes to multiple idf files.
-  Read data from the output files of a E+ simulation run.
-  Based to the results of a E+ simulation run, generate the input file
   for the next simulation run.

So what does this matter? Here are some of the things you can do with
eppy:

-  Change construction for all north facing walls.
-  Change the glass type for all windows larger than 2 square meters.
-  Change the number of people in all the interior zones.
-  Change the lighting power in all south facing zones.
-  Change the efficiency and fan power of all rooftop units.
-  Find the energy use of all the models in a folder (or of models that
   were run after a certain date)
-  If a model is using more energy than expected, keep increasing the
   R-value of the roof until you get to the expected energy use.

Quick Start

Here is a short IDF file that Iâ€™ll be using as an example to start us
off ::

        -87.75,                  !- Longitude {deg}

        190.00;                  !- Elevation {m}


To use eppy to look at this model, we have to run a little code first:

.. code:: python

    # you would normaly install eppy by doing
    # python setup.py install
    # or
    # pip install eppy
    # or
    # easy_install eppy
    
    # if you have not done so, uncomment the following three lines
    import sys
    # pathnameto_eppy = 'c:/eppy'
    pathnameto_eppy = '../'
    sys.path.append(pathnameto_eppy) 
    
    from eppy import modeleditor 
    from eppy.modeleditor import IDF
    iddfile = "../eppy/resources/iddfiles/Energy+V7_2_0.idd"
    fname1 = "../eppy/resources/idffiles/V_7_2/smallfile.idf"

.. code:: python

    IDF.setiddname(iddfile)
    idf1 = IDF(fname1)


idf1 now holds all the data to your in you idf file.

Now that the behind-the-scenes work is done, we can print this file.

.. code:: python

    idf1.printidf()


.. parsed-literal::

Looks like the same file as before, except that all the comments are
slightly different.

As you can see, this file has four objects:

-  VERSION
-  SIMULATIONCONTROL
-  BUILDING
-  SITE:LOCATION

So, let us look take a closer look at the BUILDING object. We can do
this using this command::

    print filename.idfobjects['OBJECTNAME']

.. code:: python

    print idf1.idfobjects['BUILDING']  # put the name of the object you'd like to look at in brackets


.. parsed-literal::

    [
    BUILDING,                 
        Empire State Building,    !- Name
        30.0,                     !- North Axis
        City,                     !- Terrain
        0.04,                     !- Loads Convergence Tolerance Value
        0.4,                      !- Temperature Convergence Tolerance Value
        FullExterior,             !- Solar Distribution
        25,                       !- Maximum Number of Warmup Days
        6;                        !- Minimum Number of Warmup Days
    ]


We can also zoom in on the object and look just at its individual parts.

For example, let us look at the name of the building.

To do this, we have to do some more behind-the-scenes work, which we'll
explain later.

.. code:: python

    building = idf1.idfobjects['BUILDING'][0]


Now we can do this:

.. code:: python

    print building.Name



.. parsed-literal::

    Empire State Building


Now that we've isolated the building name, we can change it.

.. code:: python

    building.Name = "Empire State Building"


.. code:: python

    print building.Name



.. parsed-literal::

    Empire State Building


Did this actually change the name in the model ? Let us print the entire
model and see.

.. code:: python

    idf1.printidf()



.. parsed-literal::

    
    VERSION,

        No,                       !- Run Simulation for Sizing Periods

        City,                     !- Terrain
        0.04,                     !- Loads Convergence Tolerance Value
        0.4,                      !- Temperature Convergence Tolerance Value

        25,                       !- Maximum Number of Warmup Days
        6;                        !- Minimum Number of Warmup Days
    
    SITE:LOCATION,            
        CHICAGO_IL_USA TMY2-94846,    !- Name
        41.78,                    !- Latitude
        -87.75,                   !- Longitude
        -6.0,                     !- Time Zone
        190.0;                    !- Elevation
    


Yes! It did. So now you have a taste of what eppy can do. Let's get
started!

Modifying IDF Fields
--------------------

That was just a quick example -- we were showing off. Let's look a
little closer.

As you might have guessed, changing an IDF field follows this
structure::

    object.fieldname = "New Field Name"


Plugging the object name (building), the field name (Name) and our new
field name ("Empire State Building") into this command gave us this:

.. code:: python

    building.Name = "Empire State Building"


.. code:: python

    import eppy
    # import eppy.ex_inits
    # reload(eppy.ex_inits)
    import eppy.ex_inits


But how did we know that "Name" is one of the fields in the object
"building"?

Are there other fields?

What are they called?

Let's take a look at the IDF editor:

.. code:: python

    from eppy import ex_inits #no need to know this code, it just shows the image below
    for_images = ex_inits
    for_images.display_png(for_images.idfeditor) 




.. image:: Main_Tutorial_files/Main_Tutorial_34_0.png


In the IDF Editor, the building object is selected.

We can see all the fields of the object "BUILDING".

They are:

-  Name
-  North Axis
-  Terrain
-  Loads Convergence Tolerance Value
-  Temperature Convergence Tolerance Value
-  Solar Distribution
-  Maximum Number of Warmup Days
-  Minimum Number of Warmup Days

Let us try to access the other fields.

.. code:: python

    print building.Terrain



.. parsed-literal::

    City


How about the field "North Axis" ?

It is not a single word, but two words.

In a programming language, a variable has to be a single word without
any spaces.

To solve this problem, put an underscore where there is a space.

So "North Axis" becomes "North\_Axis".

.. code:: python

    print building.North_Axis



.. parsed-literal::

    30.0


Now we can do:

.. code:: python

    print building.Name
    print building.North_Axis
    print building.Terrain
    print building.Loads_Convergence_Tolerance_Value
    print building.Temperature_Convergence_Tolerance_Value
    print building.Solar_Distribution
    print building.Maximum_Number_of_Warmup_Days
    print building.Minimum_Number_of_Warmup_Days



.. parsed-literal::

    Empire State Building
    30.0
    City
    0.04
    0.4
    FullExterior
    25
    6


Where else can we find the field names?

The IDF Editor saves the idf file with the field name commented next to
field.

Eppy also does this.

Let us take a look at the "BUILDING" object in the text file that the
IDF Editor saves ::

    BUILDING,
        White House,             !- Name
        30.,                     !- North Axis {deg}
        City,                    !- Terrain
        0.04,                    !- Loads Convergence Tolerance Value
        0.4,                     !- Temperature Convergence Tolerance Value {deltaC}
        FullExterior,            !- Solar Distribution
        25,                      !- Maximum Number of Warmup Days
        6;                       !- Minimum Number of Warmup Days


This a good place to find the field names too.

It is easy to copy and paste from here. You can't do that from the IDF
Editor.

We know that in an E+ model, there will be only ONE "BUILDING" object.
This will be the first and only item in the list "buildings".

But E+ models are made up of objects such as "BUILDING",
"SITE:LOCATION", "ZONE", "PEOPLE", "LIGHTS". There can be a number of
"ZONE" objects, a number of "PEOPLE" objects and a number of "LIGHTS"
objects.

So how do you know if you're looking at the first "ZONE" object or the
second one? Or the tenth one? To answer this, we need to learn about how
lists work in python.

Python lesson 1: lists
----------------------

Eppy holds these objects in a python structure called list. Let us take
a look at how lists work in python.

.. code:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "orange", "bannana"] 
    # fruits is a list with three items in it.


To get the first item in fruits we say:

.. code:: python

    fruits[0]  





.. parsed-literal::

    'apple'



Why "0" ?

Because, unlike us, python starts counting from zero in a list. So, to
get the third item in the list we'd need to input 2, like this:

.. code:: python

    print fruits[2]



.. parsed-literal::

    bannana


But calling the first fruit "fruit[0]" is rather cumbersome. Why don't
we call it firstfruit?

.. code:: python

    firstfruit = fruits[0]
    print firstfruit



.. parsed-literal::

    apple


We also can say

.. code:: python

    goodfruit = fruits[0]
    redfruit = fruits[0]
    
    print firstfruit
    print goodfruit
    print redfruit
    print fruits[0]



.. parsed-literal::

    apple
    apple
    apple
    apple


As you see, we can call that item in the list whatever we want.

How many items in the list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To know how many items are in a list, we ask for the length of the list.

The function 'len' will do this for us.

.. code:: python

    print len(fruits)



.. parsed-literal::

    3


There are 3 fruits in the list.

Saving an idf file
------------------

This is easy:

.. code:: python

    idf1.save()


If you'd like to do a "Save as..." use this:

.. code:: python

    idf1.saveas('something.idf')


Working with E+ objects
-----------------------

Let us open a small idf file that has only "CONSTRUCTION" and "MATERIAL"
objects in it. You can go into "../idffiles/V\_7\_2/constructions.idf"
and take a look at the file. We are not printing it here because it is
too big.

So let us open it using the idfreader -

.. code:: python

    from eppy import modeleditor
    from eppy.modeleditor import IDF
    
    iddfile = "../eppy/resources/iddfiles/Energy+V7_2_0.idd"
    try:
        IDF.setiddname(iddfile)
    except modeleditor.IDDAlreadySetError as e:
        pass
    
    fname1 = "../eppy/resources/idffiles/V_7_2/constructions.idf"
    idf1 = IDF(fname1)


Let us print all the "MATERIAL" objects in this model.

.. code:: python

    materials = idf1.idfobjects["MATERIAL"]
    print materials



.. parsed-literal::

        0.0254,                   !- Thickness
        0.15,                     !- Conductivity
        608.0,                    !- Density
        1630.0;                   !- Specific Heat
    ]


As you can see, there are many material objects in this idf file.

The variable "materials" now contains a list of "MATERIAL" objects.

You already know a little about lists, so let us take a look at the
items in this list.

.. code:: python

    firstmaterial = materials[0]
    secondmaterial = materials[1]


.. code:: python

    print firstmaterial



.. parsed-literal::

    
    Material,                 
        F08 Metal surface,        !- Name
        Smooth,                   !- Roughness
        0.0008,                   !- Thickness
        45.28,                    !- Conductivity
        7824.0,                   !- Density
        500.0;                    !- Specific Heat
    


Let us print secondmaterial

.. code:: python

    print secondmaterial



.. parsed-literal::

    
    Material,                 
        I01 25mm insulation board,    !- Name
        MediumRough,              !- Roughness
        0.0254,                   !- Thickness
        0.03,                     !- Conductivity
        43.0,                     !- Density
        1210.0;                   !- Specific Heat
    


This is awesome!! Why?

To understand what you can do with your objects organized as lists,
you'll have to learn a little more about lists.

Python lesson 2: more about lists
---------------------------------

More ways to access items in a list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should remember that you can access any item in a list by passing in
its index.

The tricky part is that python starts counting at 0, so you need to
input 0 in order to get the first item in a list.

Following the same logic, you need to input 3 in order to get the fourth
item on the list. Like so:

.. code:: python

    bad_architects = ["Donald Trump", "Mick Jagger", 
            "Steve Jobs", "Lady Gaga", "Santa Clause"]
    print bad_architects[3]



.. parsed-literal::

    Lady Gaga


But there's another way to access items in a list. If you input -1, it
will return the last item. -2 will give you the second-to-last item,
etc.

.. code:: python

    print bad_architects[-1]
    print bad_architects[-2]



.. parsed-literal::

    Santa Clause
    Lady Gaga


Slicing a list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also get more than one item in a list:

bad_architects[first_slice:second_slice]


.. code:: python

    print bad_architects[1:3] # slices at 1 and 3



.. parsed-literal::

    ['Mick Jagger', 'Steve Jobs']


How do I make sense of this?

To understand this you need to see the list in the following manner::

    [ "Donald Trump", "Mick Jagger", "Steve Jobs", "Lady Gaga", "Santa Clause" ]
     ^               ^              ^             ^            ^              ^
     0               1              2             3            4              5
    -5              -4             -3            -2           -1


The slice operation bad\_architects[1:3] slices right where the numbers
are.

Does that make sense?

Let us try a few other slices:

.. code:: python

    print bad_architects[2:-1] # slices at 2 and -1
    print bad_architects[-3:-1] # slices at -3 and -1



.. parsed-literal::

    ['Steve Jobs', 'Lady Gaga']
    ['Steve Jobs', 'Lady Gaga']


You can also slice in the following way:

.. code:: python

    print bad_architects[3:] 
    print bad_architects[:2] 
    print bad_architects[-3:] 
    print bad_architects[:-2] 



.. parsed-literal::

    ['Lady Gaga', 'Santa Clause']
    ['Donald Trump', 'Mick Jagger']
    ['Steve Jobs', 'Lady Gaga', 'Santa Clause']
    ['Donald Trump', 'Mick Jagger', 'Steve Jobs']


I'll let you figure that out on your own.

Adding to a list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is simple: the append function adds an item to the end of the list.

The following command will add 'something' to the end of the list called
listname::

    listname.append(something)


.. code:: python

    bad_architects.append("First-year students")
    print bad_architects



.. parsed-literal::

    ['Donald Trump', 'Mick Jagger', 'Steve Jobs', 'Lady Gaga', 'Santa Clause', 'First-year students']


Deleting from a list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to do this, based on the information you have. If you
have the value of the object, you'll want to use the remove function. It
looks like this:

listname.remove(value) 


An example:

.. code:: python

    bad_architects.remove("First-year students")
    print bad_architects



.. parsed-literal::

    ['Donald Trump', 'Mick Jagger', 'Steve Jobs', 'Lady Gaga', 'Santa Clause']


What if you know the index of the item you want to remove?

What if you appended an item by mistake and just want to remove the last
item in the list?

You should use the pop function. It looks like this:

listname.pop(index)


.. code:: python

    what_i_ate_today = ["coffee", "bacon", "eggs"]
    print what_i_ate_today



.. parsed-literal::

    ['coffee', 'bacon', 'eggs']


.. code:: python

    what_i_ate_today.append("vegetables") # adds vegetables to the end of the list
    # but I don't like vegetables
    print what_i_ate_today



.. parsed-literal::

    ['coffee', 'bacon', 'eggs', 'vegetables']


.. code:: python

    # since I don't like vegetables
    what_i_ate_today.pop(-1) # use index of -1, since vegetables is the last item in the list
    print what_i_ate_today



.. parsed-literal::

    ['coffee', 'bacon', 'eggs']


You can also remove the second item.

.. code:: python

    what_i_ate_today.pop(1)





.. parsed-literal::

    'bacon'



Notice the 'bacon' in the line above.

pop actually 'pops' the value (the one you just removed from the list)
back to you.

Let us pop the first item.

.. code:: python

    was_first_item = what_i_ate_today.pop(0)
    print 'was_first_item =', was_first_item
    print 'what_i_ate_today = ', what_i_ate_today


.. parsed-literal::

    was_first_item = coffee
    what_i_ate_today =  ['eggs']


what\_i\_ate\_today is just 'eggs'?

That is not much of a breakfast!

Let us get back to eppy.

Continuing to work with E+ objects
----------------------------------

Let us get those "MATERIAL" objects again

.. code:: python

    materials = idf1.idfobjects["MATERIAL"]


With our newfound knowledge of lists, we can do a lot of things.

Let us get the last material:

.. code:: python

    print materials[-1]



.. parsed-literal::

    
    Material,                 
        G05 25mm wood,            !- Name
        MediumSmooth,             !- Roughness
        0.0254,                   !- Thickness
        0.15,                     !- Conductivity
        608.0,                    !- Density
        1630.0;                   !- Specific Heat
    


How about the last two?

.. code:: python

    print materials[-2:]



.. parsed-literal::

    [
    Material,                 
        M05 200mm concrete block,    !- Name
        MediumRough,              !- Roughness
        0.2032,                   !- Thickness
        1.11,                     !- Conductivity
        800.0,                    !- Density
        920.0;                    !- Specific Heat
    , 
    Material,                 
        G05 25mm wood,            !- Name
        MediumSmooth,             !- Roughness
        0.0254,                   !- Thickness
        0.15,                     !- Conductivity
        608.0,                    !- Density
        1630.0;                   !- Specific Heat
    ]


Pretty good.

Counting all the materials ( or counting all objects )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How many materials are in this model ?

.. code:: python

    print len(materials)



.. parsed-literal::

    10


Removing a material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let us remove the last material in the list

.. code:: python

    was_last_material = materials.pop(-1)


.. code:: python

    print len(materials)



.. parsed-literal::

    9


Success! We have only 9 materials now.

The last material used to be:

'G05 25mm wood'

.. code:: python

    print materials[-1]



.. parsed-literal::

    
    Material,                 
        M05 200mm concrete block,    !- Name
        MediumRough,              !- Roughness
        0.2032,                   !- Thickness
        1.11,                     !- Conductivity
        800.0,                    !- Density
        920.0;                    !- Specific Heat
    


Now the last material in the list is:

'M15 200mm heavyweight concrete'

Adding a material to the list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We still have the old last material

.. code:: python

    print was_last_material



.. parsed-literal::

    
    Material,                 
        G05 25mm wood,            !- Name
        MediumSmooth,             !- Roughness
        0.0254,                   !- Thickness
        0.15,                     !- Conductivity
        608.0,                    !- Density
        1630.0;                   !- Specific Heat
    


Let us add it back to the list

.. code:: python

    materials.append(was_last_material)


.. code:: python

    print len(materials)



.. parsed-literal::

    10


Once again we have 10 materials and the last material is:

.. code:: python

    print materials[-1]



.. parsed-literal::

    
    Material,                 
        G05 25mm wood,            !- Name
        MediumSmooth,             !- Roughness
        0.0254,                   !- Thickness
        0.15,                     !- Conductivity
        608.0,                    !- Density
        1630.0;                   !- Specific Heat
    


Add a new material to the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far we have been working only with materials that were already in the
list.

What if we want to make new material?

Obviously we would use the function 'newidfobject'.

.. code:: python

    idf1.newidfobject("MATERIAL")





.. parsed-literal::

    
    MATERIAL,                 
        ,                         !- Name
        ,                         !- Roughness
        ,                         !- Thickness
        ,                         !- Conductivity
        ,                         !- Density
        ,                         !- Specific Heat
        0.9,                      !- Thermal Absorptance
        0.7,                      !- Solar Absorptance
        0.7;                      !- Visible Absorptance




.. code:: python

    len(materials)





.. parsed-literal::

    11



We have 11 items in the materials list.

Let us take a look at the last material in the list, where this fancy
new material was added

.. code:: python

    print materials[-1]



.. parsed-literal::

    
    MATERIAL,                 
        ,                         !- Name
        ,                         !- Roughness
        ,                         !- Thickness
        ,                         !- Conductivity
        ,                         !- Density
        ,                         !- Specific Heat
        0.9,                      !- Thermal Absorptance
        0.7,                      !- Solar Absorptance
        0.7;                      !- Visible Absorptance
    


Looks a little different from the other materials. It does have the name
we gave it.

Why do some fields have values and others are blank ?

"addobject" puts in all the default values, and leaves the others blank.
It is up to us to put values in the the new fields.

Let's do it now.

.. code:: python

    materials[-1].Name = 'Peanut Butter'
    materials[-1].Roughness = 'MediumSmooth'
    materials[-1].Thickness = 0.03
    materials[-1].Conductivity = 0.16
    materials[-1].Density = 600
    materials[-1].Specific_Heat = 1500


.. code:: python

    print materials[-1]



.. parsed-literal::

    
    MATERIAL,                 
        Peanut Butter,            !- Name
        MediumSmooth,             !- Roughness
        0.03,                     !- Thickness
        0.16,                     !- Conductivity
        600,                      !- Density
        1500,                     !- Specific Heat
        0.9,                      !- Thermal Absorptance
        0.7,                      !- Solar Absorptance
        0.7;                      !- Visible Absorptance
    


Copy an existing material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    Peanutbuttermaterial = materials[-1]
    idf1.copyidfobject(Peanutbuttermaterial)
    materials = idf1.idfobjects["MATERIAL"]
    len(materials)
    materials[-1]





.. parsed-literal::

    
    MATERIAL,                 
        Peanut Butter,            !- Name
        MediumSmooth,             !- Roughness
        0.03,                     !- Thickness
        0.16,                     !- Conductivity
        600,                      !- Density
        1500,                     !- Specific Heat
        0.9,                      !- Thermal Absorptance
        0.7,                      !- Solar Absorptance
        0.7;                      !- Visible Absorptance




Python lesson 3: indentation and looping through lists
------------------------------------------------------

I'm tired of doing all this work, it's time to make python do some heavy
lifting for us!

Python can go through each item in a list and perform an operation on
any (or every) item in the list.

This is called looping through the list.

Here's how to tell python to step through each item in a list, and then
do something to every single item.

We'll use a 'for' loop to do this. ::

    for <variable> in <listname>:
        <do something>
            

A quick note about the second line. Notice that it's indented? There are
4 blank spaces before the code starts::

    in python, indentations are used    
    to determine the grouping of statements  
           some languages use symbols to mark 
           where the function code starts and stops   
           but python uses indentation to tell you this  
                    i'm using indentation to
                    show the beginning and end of a sentence
           this is a very simple explanation
           of indentation in python
     if you'd like to know more, there is plenty of information
     about indentation in python on the web
    

It's elegant, but it means that the indentation of the code holds
meaning.

So make sure to indent the second (and third and forth) lines of your
loops!

Now let's make some fruit loops.

.. code:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "orange", "bannana"] 


Given the syntax I gave you before I started rambling about indentation,
we can easily print every item in the fruits list by using a 'for' loop.

.. code:: python

    for fruit in fruits:
       print fruit
        


.. parsed-literal::

    apple
    orange
    bannana


That was easy! But it can get complicated pretty quickly...

Let's make it do something more complicated than just print the fruits.

Let's have python add some words to each fruit.

.. code:: python

    for fruit in fruits:
        print "I am a fruit said the", fruit
        


.. parsed-literal::

    I am a fruit said the apple
    I am a fruit said the orange
    I am a fruit said the bannana


Now we'll try to confuse you:

.. code:: python

    rottenfruits = [] # makes a blank list called rottenfruits
    for fruit in fruits: # steps through every item in fruits
        rottenfruit = "rotten " + fruit # changes each item to "rotten _____"
        rottenfruits.append(rottenfruit) # adds each changed item to the formerly empty list
        

.. code:: python

    print rottenfruits



.. parsed-literal::

    ['rotten apple', 'rotten orange', 'rotten bannana']


.. code:: python

    # here's a shorter way of writing it
    rottenfruits = ["rotten " + fruit for fruit in fruits]


Did you follow all that??

Just in case you didn't, let's review that last one::

    ["rotten " + fruit for fruit in fruits]
                       -------------------
                       This is the "for loop"
                       it steps through each fruit in fruits
    
    ["rotten " + fruit for fruit in fruits]
     -----------------
     add "rotten " to the fruit at each step
     this is your "do something"
     
    ["rotten " + fruit for fruit in fruits]
    ---------------------------------------
    give a new list that is a result of the "do something"


.. code:: python

    print rottenfruits



.. parsed-literal::

    ['rotten apple', 'rotten orange', 'rotten bannana']


Filtering in a loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But what if you don't want to change *every* item in a list?

We can use an 'if' statement to operate on only some items in the list.

Indentation is also important in 'if' statements, as you'll see::

    if <someconstraint>:
        <if the first line is true, do this>
    <but if it's false, do this>
               

.. code:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "orange", "pear", "berry", "mango", "plum", "peach", "melon", "bannana"]


.. code:: python

    for fruit in fruits:               # steps through every fruit in fruits
        if len(fruit) > 5:             # checks to see if the length of the word is more than 5
            print fruit                # if true, print the fruit
                                       # if false, python goes back to the 'for' loop 
                                          # and checks the next item in the list
                    


.. parsed-literal::

    orange
    bannana


Let's say we want to pick only the fruits that start with the letter
'p'.

    p_fruits = []                      # creates an empty list called p_fruits
    for fruit in fruits:               # steps through every fruit in fruits
        if fruit.startswith("p"):      # checks to see if the first letter is 'p', using a built-in function
            p_fruits.append(fruit)     # if the first letter is 'p', the item is added to p_fruits
                                       # if the first letter is not 'p', python goes back to the 'for' loop
                                          # and checks the next item in the list
                    

.. code:: python

    print p_fruits



.. parsed-literal::

    ['pear', 'plum', 'peach']


.. code:: python

    # here's a shorter way to write it
    p_fruits = [fruit for fruit in fruits if fruit.startswith("p")]


::

    [fruit for fruit in fruits if fruit.startswith("p")]
           -------------------
           for loop
    
    [fruit for fruit in fruits if fruit.startswith("p")]
                               ------------------------
                               pick only some of the fruits
    
    [fruit for fruit in fruits if fruit.startswith("p")]
     -----
     give me the variable fruit as it appears in the list, don't change it
     
    [fruit for fruit in fruits if fruit.startswith("p")]
    ----------------------------------------------------
    a fresh new list with those fruits
    

.. code:: python

Counting through loops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is not really needed, but it is nice to know. You can safely skip
this.

Python's built-in function range() makes a list of numbers within a
range that you specify.

This is useful because you can use these lists inside of loops.

.. code:: python

    range(4) # makes a list





.. parsed-literal::

    [0, 1, 2, 3]



.. code:: python

    for i in range(4):
        print i
        


.. parsed-literal::

    0
    1
    2
    3


.. code:: python

    len(p_fruits)





.. parsed-literal::

    3



.. code:: python

    for i in range(len(p_fruits)):
        print i
        


.. parsed-literal::

    0
    1
    2


.. code:: python

    for i in range(len(p_fruits)):
        print p_fruits[i]
        


.. parsed-literal::

    pear
    plum
    peach


.. code:: python

    for i in range(len(p_fruits)):
        print i,  p_fruits[i]
        


.. parsed-literal::

    0 pear
    1 plum
    2 peach


.. code:: python

    for item_from_enumerate in enumerate(p_fruits):
        print item_from_enumerate
        


.. parsed-literal::

    (0, 'pear')
    (1, 'plum')
    (2, 'peach')


.. code:: python

    for i, fruit in enumerate(p_fruits):
        print i, fruit
        


.. parsed-literal::

    0 pear
    1 plum
    2 peach


Looping through E+ objects
--------------------------

If you have read the python explanation of loops, you are now masters of
using loops.

Let us use the loops with E+ objects.

We'll continue to work with the materials list.

So now we're working with two different lists: materials and
thick\_materials.

But even though the items can be separated into two lists, we're still
working with the same items.

Here's a helpful illustration:

.. code:: python

    for_images.display_png(for_images.material_lists) # display the image below



.. image:: Main_Tutorial_files/Main_Tutorial_207_0.png


.. code:: python

    # here's the same concept, demonstrated with code
    # remember, we changed the names of the items in the list thick_materials
    # these changes are visible when we print the materials list; the thick materials are also in the materials list
    [material.Name for material in materials]





.. parsed-literal::

    [u'F08 Metal surface',
     u'I01 25mm insulation board',
     u'I02 50mm insulation board',

     u'THICK M11 100mm lightweight concrete',
     u'F16 Acoustic tile',
     u'THICK M01 100mm brick',
     u'THICK M15 200mm heavyweight concrete',
     u'THICK M05 200mm concrete block',

     'Peanut Butter',

Geometry functions in eppy
--------------------------

Sometimes, we want information about the E+ object that is not in the
fields. For example, it would be useful to know the areas and
orientations of the surfaces. These attributes of the surfaces are not
in the fields of surfaces, but surface objects *do* have fields that
have the coordinates of the surface. The areas and orientations can be
calculated from these coordinates.

Pyeplus has some functions that will do the calculations.

In the present version, pyeplus will calculate:

-  surface azimuth
-  surface tilt
-  surface area

Let us explore these functions

.. code:: python

    # OLD CODE, SHOULD BE DELETED

    # surfaces = model['BUILDINGSURFACE:DETAILED'] # all the surfaces

    try:
        IDF.setiddname(iddfile)
    except modeleditor.IDDAlreadySetError as e:
        pass
    
    
    fname1 = "../eppy/resources/idffiles/V_7_0/5ZoneSupRetPlenRAB.idf"
    idf1 = IDF(fname1)
    surfaces = idf1.idfobjects['BUILDINGSURFACE:DETAILED']


.. code:: python

    # Let us look at the first surface
    asurface = surfaces[0]
    print "surface azimuth =",  asurface.azimuth, "degrees"

This shows that very sophisticated modification can be made to the model
