HVAC Loops
==========

Conceptual Introduction to HVAC Loops
-------------------------------------

Eppy builds threee kinds of loops for the energyplus idf file:

1. Plant Loops
2. Condensor Loops
3. Air Loops

All loops have two halves:

1. Supply side
2. Demand Side

The supply side provides the energy to the demand side that needs the
energy. So the end-nodes on the supply side connect to the end-nodes on
the demand side.

The loop is made up of branches connected to each other. A single branch
can lead to multiple branches through a **splitter** component. Multiple
branches can lead to a single branch through a **mixer** component.

Each branch is made up of components connected in series (in a line)

Eppy starts off by building the shape or topology of the loop by
connecting the branches in the right order. The braches themselves have
a single component in them, that is just a place holder. Usually it is a
pipe component. In an air loop it would be a duct component.

The shape of the loop for the supply or demand side is quite simple.

It can be described in the following manner for the supply side

-  The supply side starts single branch leads to a splitter
-  The splitter leads to multiple branches
-  these multiple branches come back and join in a mixer
-  the mixer leads to a single branch that becomes end of the suppply
   side

For the demand side we have:

-  The demand side starts single branch leads to a splitter
-  The splitter leads to multiple branches
-  these multiple branches come back and join in a mixer
-  the mixer leads to a single branch that becomes end of the demand
   side

The two ends of the supply side connect to the two ends of the demand
side.

Diagramtically the the two sides of the loop will look like this::

    Supply Side:
    ------------
                    -> branch1 -> 
    start_branch   --> branch2 --> end_branch
                    -> branch3 ->
    Demand Side:
    ------------
    
                      -> d_branch1 -> 
    d_start_branch   --> d_branch2 --> d_end_branch
                      -> d_branch3 ->
    

In eppy you could embody this is a list

.. code:: python

    supplyside = ['start_brandh',   [  'branch1',   'branch2',   'branch3'],   'end_branch']
    demandside = ['d_start_brandh', ['d_branch1', 'd_branch2', 'd_branch3'], 'd_end_branch']


Eppy will build the build the shape/topology of the loop using the two
lists above. Each branch will have a placeholder component, like a pipe
or a duct::

    
    branch1 = --duct--


Now we will have to replace the placeholder with the real components
that make up the loop. For instance, branch1 should really have a
pre-heat coil leading to a supply fan leading to a cooling coil leading
to a heating coil::

    
    new_branch = pre-heatcoil -> supplyfan -> coolingcoil -> heatingcoil


Eppy lets you build a new branch and you can replace branch1 with
new\_branch

In this manner we can build up the entire loop with the right
components, once the initial toplogy is right

Building a Plant loops
----------------------

Eppy can build up the topology of a plant loop using single pipes in a
branch. Once we do that the simple branch in the loop we have built can
be replaced with a more complex branch.

Let us try this out ans see how it works.

Building the topology of the loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # you would normaly install eppy by doing
    # python setup.py install
    # or
    # pip install eppy
    # or
    # easy_install eppy
    
    # if you have not done so, uncomment the following three lines
    import sys
    # pathnameto_eppy = 'c:/eppy'
    pathnameto_eppy = '../'
    sys.path.append(pathnameto_eppy) 


.. code:: python

    from eppy.modeleditor import IDF
    from eppy import hvacbuilder
    
    from StringIO import StringIO
    iddfile = "../eppy/resources/iddfiles/Energy+V7_0_0_036.idd"
    IDF.setiddname(iddfile)


.. code:: python

    # make the topology of the loop
    idf = IDF(StringIO('')) # makes an empty idf file in memory with no file name
    loopname = "p_loop"
    sloop = ['sb0', ['sb1', 'sb2', 'sb3'], 'sb4'] # supply side of the loop
    dloop = ['db0', ['db1', 'db2', 'db3'], 'db4'] # demand side of the loop
    hvacbuilder.makeplantloop(idf, loopname, sloop, dloop)
    idf.saveas("hhh1.idf")


| We have made plant loop and saved it as hhh1.idf.
| Now let us look at what the loop looks like.

Diagram of the loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us use the script "eppy/useful\_scripts/loopdiagrams.py" to draw
this diagram

See `Generating a Loop Diagram <useful_scripts.html#loopdiagram-py>`__
page for details on how to do this

Below is the diagram for this simple loop

*Note: the supply and demnd sides are not connected in the diagram, but
shown seperately for clarity*

.. code:: python

    from eppy import ex_inits #no need to know this code, it just shows the image below
    for_images = ex_inits
    for_images.display_png(for_images.plantloop1) # display the image below




.. image:: HVAC_Tutorial_files/HVAC_Tutorial_23_0.png


Modifying the topology of the loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us make a new branch and replace the exisiting branch

The existing branch name is "sb0" and it contains a single pipe
component sb0\_pipe.

Let us replace it with a branch that has a chiller that is connected to
a pipe which is turn connected to another pipe. So the connections in
the new branch would look like "chiller-> pipe1->pipe2"

.. code:: python

    # make a new branch chiller->pipe1-> pipe2
    
    # make a new pipe component
    pipe1 = idf.newidfobject("PIPE:ADIABATIC", 'np1')
    
    # make a new chiller
    chiller = idf.newidfobject("Chiller:Electric".upper(), 'Central_Chiller')
    
    # make another pipe component
    pipe2 = idf.newidfobject("PIPE:ADIABATIC", 'np2')
    
    # get the loop we are trying to modify
    loop = idf.getobject('PLANTLOOP', 'p_loop') # args are (key, name)
    # get the branch we are trying to modify
    branch = idf.getobject('BRANCH', 'sb0') # args are (key, name)
    listofcomponents = [chiller, pipe1, pipe2] # the new components are connected in this order


Now we are going to try to replace **branch** with the a branch made up
of **listofcomponents**

-  We will do this by calling the function replacebranch
-  Calling replacebranch can throw an exception ``WhichLoopError``
-  In a moment, you will see why this exception is important

.. code:: python

    try:
        newbr = hvacbuilder.replacebranch(idf, loop, branch, listofcomponents, fluid='Water')
    except hvacbuilder.WhichLoopError as e:
        print e



.. parsed-literal::

    Where should this loop connect ?
    CHILLER:ELECTRIC - Central_Chiller
    [u'Chilled_Water_', u'Condenser_', u'Heat_Recovery_']
    


The above code throws the exception. It says that the idfobject
``CHILLER:ELECTRIC - Central_Chiller`` has three possible connections.
The chiller has inlet outlet nodes for the following

-  Chilled water
-  Condenser
-  Heat Recovery

eppy does not know which one to connect to, and it needs your help. We
know that the chiller needs to be connected to the chilled water inlet
and outlet. Simply copy ``Chilled_Water_`` from the text in the
exception and paste as shown in the code below. (make sure you copy it
exactly. eppy is a little nerdy about that)

.. code:: python

    # instead of passing chiller to the function, we pass a tuple (chiller, 'Chilled_Water_').
    # This lets eppy know where the connection should be made.
    # The idfobject pipe does not have this ambiguity. So pipes do not need this extra information
    listofcomponents = [(chiller, 'Chilled_Water_'), pipe1, pipe2]
    
    try:
        newbr = hvacbuilder.replacebranch(idf, loop, branch, listofcomponents, fluid='Water')
    except Exception as e:
        print e
    else: # else will run only if the try suceeds
        print "no exception was thrown"
    
    idf.saveas("hhh_new.idf")



.. parsed-literal::

    no exception was thrown


*Tagential note*: The ``"try .. except .. else"`` statement is useful
here. If you have not run across it before, take a look at these two
links

-  http://shahriar.svbtle.com/the-possibly-forgotten-optional-else-in-python-try-statement
-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html

| We have saved this as file "hhh\_new.idf".
| Let us draw the diagram of this file. (run this from eppy/eppy folder)

python ex_loopdiagram.py hhh_new.idf


.. code:: python

    from eppy import ex_inits #no need to know this code, it just shows the image below
    for_images = ex_inits
    for_images.display_png(for_images.plantloop2) # display the image below




.. image:: HVAC_Tutorial_files/HVAC_Tutorial_34_0.png


This diagram shows the new components in the branch

Work flow with ``WhichLoopError``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are writing scripts don't bother to use ``try .. except`` for
``WhichLoopError``.

-  Simply allow the exception to be raised.
-  Use the information in the exception to update your code
-  You may have to do this a couple of times in your script.
-  In a sense you are letting eppy tell you how to update the script.

*Question:* I am writing an application using eppy, not just a script.
The above workflow does not work for me

*Response:* Aha ! If that is the case, open an issue in
`github/eppy <https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy>`__. We are lazy
people. We don't write code unless it is needed :-)

Traversing the loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It would be nice to move through the loop using functions "nextnode()"
and "prevnode()"

Eppy indeed has such functions

Let us try to traverse the loop above.

.. code:: python

    # to traverse the loop we are going to call some functions ex_loopdiagrams.py, 
    # the program that draws the loop diagrams.
    from eppy import ex_loopdiagram
    fname = 'hhh_new.idf'
    iddfile = '../eppy/resources/iddfiles/Energy+V8_0_0.idd'
    edges = ex_loopdiagram.getedges(fname, iddfile)
    # edges are the lines that draw the nodes in the loop. 
    # The term comes from graph theory in mathematics


The above code gets us the edges of the loop diagram. Once we have the
edges, we can traverse through the diagram. Let us start with the
"Central\_Chiller" and work our way down.

.. code:: python

    from eppy import walk_hvac
    firstnode = "Central_Chiller"
    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, firstnode)
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'np1']


.. code:: python

    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, nextnodes[0])
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'np2']


.. code:: python

    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, nextnodes[0])
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'p_loop_supply_splitter']


.. code:: python

    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, nextnodes[0])
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'sb1_pipe', u'sb2_pipe', u'sb3_pipe']


This leads us to three components -> ['sb1\_pipe', 'sb2\_pipe',
'sb3\_pipe']. Let us follow one of them

.. code:: python

    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, nextnodes[0])
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'p_loop_supply_mixer']


.. code:: python

    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, nextnodes[0])
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'sb4_pipe']


.. code:: python

    nextnodes = walk_hvac.nextnode(edges, nextnodes[0])
    print nextnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    []


We have reached the end of this branch. There are no more components.

We can follow this in reverse using the function prevnode()

.. code:: python

    lastnode = 'sb4_pipe'
    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, lastnode)
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'p_loop_supply_mixer']


.. code:: python

    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, prevnodes[0])
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'sb1_pipe', u'sb2_pipe', u'sb3_pipe']


.. code:: python

    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, prevnodes[0])
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'p_loop_supply_splitter']


.. code:: python

    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, prevnodes[0])
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'np2']


.. code:: python

    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, prevnodes[0])
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'np1']


.. code:: python

    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, prevnodes[0])
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'Central_Chiller']


.. code:: python

    prevnodes = walk_hvac.prevnode(edges, prevnodes[0])
    print prevnodes



.. parsed-literal::

    []


All the way to where the loop ends

Building a Condensor loop
-------------------------

We build the condensor loop the same way we built the plant loop. Pipes
are put as place holders for the components. Let us build a new idf file
with just a condensor loop in it.

.. code:: python

    condensorloop_idf = IDF(StringIO('')) 
    loopname = "c_loop"
    sloop = ['sb0', ['sb1', 'sb2', 'sb3'], 'sb4'] # supply side
    dloop = ['db0', ['db1', 'db2', 'db3'], 'db4'] # demand side
    theloop = hvacbuilder.makecondenserloop(condensorloop_idf, loopname, sloop, dloop)
    condensorloop_idf.saveas("c_loop.idf")


Again, just as we did in the plant loop, we can change the components of
the loop, by replacing the branchs and traverse the loop using the
functions nextnode() and prevnode()

Building an Air Loop
--------------------

Building an air loop is similar to the plant and condensor loop. The
difference is that instead of pipes , we have ducts as placeholder
components. The other difference is that we have zones on the demand
side.

.. code:: python

    airloop_idf = IDF(StringIO('')) 
    loopname = "a_loop"
    sloop = ['sb0', ['sb1', 'sb2', 'sb3'], 'sb4'] # supply side of the loop
    dloop = ['zone1', 'zone2', 'zone3'] # zones on the demand side
    hvacbuilder.makeairloop(airloop_idf, loopname, sloop, dloop)
    airloop_idf.saveas("a_loop.idf")


Again, just as we did in the plant and condensor loop, we can change the
components of the loop, by replacing the branchs and traverse the loop
using the functions nextnode() and prevnode()
