Reading outputs from E+
=======================

.. code:: python

    # some initial set up
    # if you have not installed epp, and only downloaded it
    # you will need the following lines
    import sys
    # pathnameto_eppy = 'c:/eppy'
    pathnameto_eppy = '../'
    sys.path.append(pathnameto_eppy) 


Using titletable() to get at the tables
---------------------------------------

So far we have been making changes to the IDF input file. How about
looking at the outputs.

Energyplus makes nice htmlout files that look like this.

.. code:: python

    from eppy import ex_inits #no need to know this code, it just shows the image below
    for_images = ex_inits
    for_images.display_png(for_images.html_snippet1) #display the image below




.. image:: Outputs_Tutorial_files/Outputs_Tutorial_4_0.png


If you look at the clipping of the html file above, you see tables with
data in them. Eppy has functions that let you access of these tables and
get the data from any of it's cells.

Let us say you want to find the "Net Site Energy".

This is in table "Site and Source Energy".

The number you want is in the third row, second column and it's value is
"47694.47"

Let us use eppy to extract this number

.. code:: python

    from eppy.results import readhtml # the eppy module with functions to read the html
    fname = "../eppy/resources/outputfiles/V_7_2/5ZoneCAVtoVAVWarmestTempFlowTable_ABUPS.html" # the html file you want to read
    filehandle = open(fname, 'r').read() # get a file handle to the html file
    
    
    htables = readhtml.titletable(filehandle) # reads the tables with their titles


If you open the python file readhtml.py and look at the function
titletable, you can see the function documentation.

It says the following

    """return a list of [(title, table), .....]
    title = previous item with a <b> tag
    table = rows -> [[cell1, cell2, ..], [cell1, cell2, ..], ..]"""
    

The documentation says that it returns a list. Let us take a look inside
this list. Let us look at the first item in the list.

.. code:: python

    firstitem = htables[0]
    print firstitem



.. parsed-literal::

    (u'Site and Source Energy', [[u'', u'Total Energy [kWh]', u'Energy Per Total Building Area [kWh/m2]', u'Energy Per Conditioned Building Area [kWh/m2]'], [u'Total Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44], [u'Net Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44], [u'Total Source Energy', 140159.1, 151.16, 151.16], [u'Net Source Energy', 140159.1, 151.16, 151.16]])


| Ughh !!! that is ugly. Hard to see what it is.
| Let us use a python module to print it pretty

.. code:: python

    import pprint
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()
    pp.pprint(firstitem)



.. parsed-literal::

    (u'Site and Source Energy',
     [[u'',
       u'Total Energy [kWh]',
       u'Energy Per Total Building Area [kWh/m2]',
       u'Energy Per Conditioned Building Area [kWh/m2]'],
      [u'Total Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44],
      [u'Net Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44],
      [u'Total Source Energy', 140159.1, 151.16, 151.16],
      [u'Net Source Energy', 140159.1, 151.16, 151.16]])


Nice. that is a little clearer

.. code:: python

    firstitem_title = firstitem[0]
    pp.pprint(firstitem_title)



.. parsed-literal::

    u'Site and Source Energy'


.. code:: python

    firstitem_table = firstitem[1]
    pp.pprint(firstitem_table)



.. parsed-literal::

    [[u'',
      u'Total Energy [kWh]',
      u'Energy Per Total Building Area [kWh/m2]',
      u'Energy Per Conditioned Building Area [kWh/m2]'],
     [u'Total Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44],
     [u'Net Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44],
     [u'Total Source Energy', 140159.1, 151.16, 151.16],
     [u'Net Source Energy', 140159.1, 151.16, 151.16]]


| How do we get to value of "Net Site Energy".
| We know it is in the third row, second column of the table.

Easy.

.. code:: python

    thirdrow = firstitem_table[2] # we start counting with 0. So 0, 1, 2 is third row
    print thirdrow



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'Net Site Energy', 47694.47, 51.44, 51.44]


.. code:: python

    thirdrow_secondcolumn = thirdrow[1]
    thirdrow_secondcolumn





.. parsed-literal::

    47694.47



| the text from the html table is in unicode.
| That is why you see that weird 'u' letter.

Let us convert it to a floating point number

.. code:: python

    net_site_energy = float(thirdrow_secondcolumn)
    net_site_energy





.. parsed-literal::

    47694.47



Let us have a little fun with the tables.

Get the titles of all the tables

.. code:: python

    alltitles = [htable[0] for htable in htables]
    alltitles





.. parsed-literal::

    [u'Site and Source Energy',
     u'Site to Source Energy Conversion Factors',
     u'Building Area',
     u'End Uses',
     u'End Uses By Subcategory',
     u'Utility Use Per Conditioned Floor Area',
     u'Utility Use Per Total Floor Area',
     u'Electric Loads Satisfied',
     u'On-Site Thermal Sources',
     u'Water Source Summary',
     u'Comfort and Setpoint Not Met Summary',
     u'Comfort and Setpoint Not Met Summary']



Now let us grab the tables with the titles "Building Area" and "Site to
Source Energy Conversion Factors"

twotables = [htable for htable in htables if htable[0] in ["Building
Area", "Site to Source Energy Conversion Factors"]] twotables

Let us leave readtables for now.

It gives us the basic functionality to read any of the tables in the
html output file.

Using lines\_table() to get at the tables
-----------------------------------------

We have been using titletable() to get at the tables. There is a
constraint using function titletable(). Titletable() assumes that there
is a unique title (in HTML bold) just above the table. It is assumed
that this title will adequetly describe the table. This is true in most
cases and titletable() is perfectly good to use. Unfortuntely there are
some tables that do not follow this rule. The snippet below shows one of
them.

.. code:: python

    from eppy import ex_inits #no need to know this code, it just shows the image below
    for_images = ex_inits
    for_images.display_png(for_images.html_snippet2) # display the image below




.. image:: Outputs_Tutorial_files/Outputs_Tutorial_28_0.png


Notice that the HTML snippet shows a table with three lines above it.
The first two lines have information that describe the table. We need to
look at both those lines to understand what the table contains. So we
need a different function that will capture all those lines before the
table. The funtion lines\_table() described below will do this.

.. code:: python

    from eppy.results import readhtml # the eppy module with functions to read the html
    fname = "../eppy/resources/outputfiles/V_8_1/ASHRAE30pct.PI.Final11_OfficeMedium_STD2010_Chicago-baseTable.html" # the html file you want to read
    filehandle = open(fname, 'r').read() # get a file handle to the html file
    
    
    ltables = readhtml.lines_table(filehandle) # reads the tables with their titles


The html snippet shown above is the last table in HTML file we just
opened. We have used lines\_table() to read the tables into the variable
ltables. We can get to the last table by ltable[-1]. Let us print it and
see what we have.

.. code:: python

    import pprint
    pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()
    pp.pprint(ltables[-1])



.. parsed-literal::

    [[u'Table of Contents',
      u'Report: FANGER DURING COOLING AND ADAPTIVE COMFORT',
      u'For: PERIMETER_MID_ZN_4',
      u'Timestamp: 2014-02-07\n    12:29:08'],
     [[u'',
       u'ZONE/SYS SENSIBLE COOLING RATE {HOURS POSITIVE} [HOURS]',
       u'FANGERPPD {FOR HOURS SHOWN} []',
       u'FANGERPPD []'],
      [u'January', 102.637, 12.585, 32.231],
      [u'February', 147.054, 10.5, 24.225],
      [u'March', 286.835, 8.799, 16.86],
      [u'April', 363.165, 7.704, 9.628],
      [u'May', 428.458, 19.642, 21.401],
      [u'June', 431.25, 10.092, 9.954],
      [u'July', 432.134, 8.835, 7.959],
      [u'August', 443.5, 9.743, 8.785],
      [u'September', 408.833, 15.91, 14.855],
      [u'October', 383.652, 6.919, 7.57],
      [u'November', 243.114, 8.567, 15.256],
      [u'December', 91.926, 14.298, 29.001],
      [u'\xa0', u'\xa0', u'\xa0', u'\xa0'],
      [u'Annual Sum or Average', 3762.56, 11.062, 16.458],
      [u'Minimum of Months', 91.926, 6.919, 7.57],
      [u'Maximum of Months', 443.5, 19.642, 32.231]]]


We can see that ltables has captured all the lines before the table. Let
us make our code more explicit to see this

.. code:: python

    last_ltable = ltables[-1]
    lines_before_table = last_ltable[0]
    table_itself = last_ltable[-1]
    
    pp.pprint(lines_before_table)



.. parsed-literal::

    [u'Table of Contents',
     u'Report: FANGER DURING COOLING AND ADAPTIVE COMFORT',
     u'For: PERIMETER_MID_ZN_4',
     u'Timestamp: 2014-02-07\n    12:29:08']


We found this table the easy way this time, because we knew it was the
last one. How do we find it if we don't know where it is in the file ?
Python comes to our rescue :-) Let assume that we want to find the table
that has the following two lines before it.

-  Report: FANGER DURING COOLING AND ADAPTIVE COMFORT
-  For: PERIMETER\_MID\_ZN\_4

.. code:: python

    line1 = 'Report: FANGER DURING COOLING AND ADAPTIVE COMFORT'
    line2 = 'For: PERIMETER_MID_ZN_4'
    #
    # check if those two lines are before the table
    line1 in lines_before_table and line2 in lines_before_table





.. parsed-literal::

    True



.. code:: python

    # find all the tables where those two lines are before the table
    [ltable for ltable in ltables 
        if line1 in ltable[0] and line2 in ltable[0]]





.. parsed-literal::

    [[[u'Table of Contents',
       u'Report: FANGER DURING COOLING AND ADAPTIVE COMFORT',
       u'For: PERIMETER_MID_ZN_4',
       u'Timestamp: 2014-02-07\n    12:29:08'],
      [[u'',
        u'ZONE/SYS SENSIBLE COOLING RATE {HOURS POSITIVE} [HOURS]',
        u'FANGERPPD {FOR HOURS SHOWN} []',
        u'FANGERPPD []'],
       [u'January', 102.637, 12.585, 32.231],
       [u'February', 147.054, 10.5, 24.225],
       [u'March', 286.835, 8.799, 16.86],
       [u'April', 363.165, 7.704, 9.628],
       [u'May', 428.458, 19.642, 21.401],
       [u'June', 431.25, 10.092, 9.954],
       [u'July', 432.134, 8.835, 7.959],
       [u'August', 443.5, 9.743, 8.785],
       [u'September', 408.833, 15.91, 14.855],
       [u'October', 383.652, 6.919, 7.57],
       [u'November', 243.114, 8.567, 15.256],
       [u'December', 91.926, 14.298, 29.001],
       [u'\xa0', u'\xa0', u'\xa0', u'\xa0'],
       [u'Annual Sum or Average', 3762.56, 11.062, 16.458],
       [u'Minimum of Months', 91.926, 6.919, 7.57],
       [u'Maximum of Months', 443.5, 19.642, 32.231]]]]



That worked !

What if you want to find the words "FANGER" and "PERIMETER\_MID\_ZN\_4"
before the table. The following code will do it.

.. code:: python

    # sample code to illustrate what we are going to do
    last_ltable = ltables[-1]
    lines_before_table = last_ltable[0]
    table_itself = last_ltable[-1]
    
    # join lines_before_table into a paragraph of text
    justtext = '\n'.join(lines_before_table)
    print justtext



.. parsed-literal::

.. code:: python

    "FANGER" in justtext and "PERIMETER_MID_ZN_4" in justtext





.. parsed-literal::

    True



.. code:: python

    # Let us combine the this trick to find the table
    [ltable for ltable in ltables 
        if "FANGER" in '\n'.join(ltable[0]) and "PERIMETER_MID_ZN_4" in '\n'.join(ltable[0])]




.. parsed-literal::

Extracting data from the tables
-------------------------------

The tables in the HTML page in general have text in the top header row.
The first vertical row has text. The remaining cells have numbers. We
can identify the numbers we need by looking at the labelin the top row
and the label in the first column. Let us construct a simple example and
explore this.

.. code:: python

    # ignore the following three lines. I am using them to construct the table below
    from IPython.display import HTML
    atablestring = '<TABLE cellpadding="4" style="border: 1px solid #000000; border-collapse: collapse;" border="1">\n <TR>\n  <TD>&nbsp;</TD>\n  <TD>a b</TD>\n  <TD>b c</TD>\n  <TD>c d</TD>\n </TR>\n <TR>\n  <TD>x y</TD>\n  <TD>1</TD>\n  <TD>2</TD>\n  <TD>3</TD>\n </TR>\n <TR>\n  <TD>y z</TD>\n  <TD>4</TD>\n  <TD>5</TD>\n  <TD>6</TD>\n </TR>\n <TR>\n  <TD>z z</TD>\n  <TD>7</TD>\n  <TD>8</TD>\n  <TD>9</TD>\n </TR>\n</TABLE>'
    HTML(atablestring)





.. raw:: html

    <TABLE cellpadding="4" style="border: 1px solid #000000; border-collapse: collapse;" border="1">
     <TR>
      <TD>&nbsp;</TD>
      <TD>a b</TD>
      <TD>b c</TD>
      <TD>c d</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD>x y</TD>
      <TD>1</TD>
      <TD>2</TD>
      <TD>3</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD>y z</TD>
      <TD>4</TD>
      <TD>5</TD>
      <TD>6</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD>z z</TD>
      <TD>7</TD>
      <TD>8</TD>
      <TD>9</TD>
     </TR>
    </TABLE>



This table is actually in the follwoing form:

.. code:: python

    atable = [["",  "a b", "b c", "c d"],
         ["x y", 1,     2,     3 ],
         ["y z", 4,     5,     6 ],
         ["z z", 7,     8,     9 ],]


We can see the labels in the table. So we an look at row "x y" and
column "c d". The value there is 3

right now we can get to it by saying atable[1][3]

.. code:: python

    print atable[1][3]


.. parsed-literal::

    3


readhtml has some functions that will let us address the values by the
labels. We use a structure from python called named tuples to do this.
The only limitation is that the labels have to be letters or digits.
Named tuples does not allow spaces in the labels. We could replace the
space with an underscore ' \_ '. So "a b" will become "a\_b". So we can
look for row "x\_y" and column "c\_d". Let us try this out.

.. code:: python

    from eppy.results import readhtml
    h_table = readhtml.named_grid_h(atable)


.. code:: python

    print h_table.x_y.c_d



.. parsed-literal::

    3


We can still get to the value by index

.. code:: python

    print h_table[0][2]



.. parsed-literal::

    3


Note that we used atable[1][3], but here we used h\_table[0][2]. That is
because h\_table does not count the rows and columns where the labels
are.

We can also do the following:

.. code:: python

    print h_table.x_y[2]
    # or
    print h_table[0].c_d



.. parsed-literal::

    3
    3


Wow … that is pretty cool. What if we want to just check what the labels
are ?

.. code:: python

    print h_table._fields



.. parsed-literal::

    ('x_y', 'y_z', 'z_z')


That gives us the horizontal lables. How about the vertical labels ?

.. code:: python

    h_table.x_y._fields





.. parsed-literal::

    ('a_b', 'b_c', 'c_d')



There you go !!!

How about if I want to use the labels differently ? Say I want to refer
to the row first and then to the column. That woul be saying
table.c\_d.x\_y. We can do that by using a different function

.. code:: python

    v_table = readhtml.named_grid_v(atable)
    print v_table.c_d.x_y



.. parsed-literal::

    3


And we can do the following

.. code:: python

    print v_table[2][0]
    print v_table.c_d[0]
    print v_table[2].x_y



.. parsed-literal::

    3
    3
    3


Let us try to get the numbers in the first column and then get their sum

.. code:: python

    v_table.a_b





.. parsed-literal::

    ntrow(x_y=1, y_z=4, z_z=7)



Look like we got the right column. But not in the right format. We
really need a list of numbers

.. code:: python

    [cell for cell in v_table.a_b]





.. parsed-literal::

    [1, 4, 7]



That looks like waht we wanted. Now let us get the sum

.. code:: python

    values_in_first_column = [cell for cell in v_table.a_b]
    print values_in_first_column
    print sum(values_in_first_column) # sum is a builtin function that will sum a list



.. parsed-literal::

    [1, 4, 7]
    12


To get the first row we use the variable h\_table

.. code:: python

    values_in_first_row = [cell for cell in h_table.x_y]
    print values_in_first_row
    print sum(values_in_first_row)



.. parsed-literal::

    [1, 2, 3]
    6
