Running EnergyPlus from Eppy
============================

It would be great if we could run EnergyPlus directly from our IDF
wouldn’t it?

Well here’s how we can.

.. code:: python

    # you would normaly install eppy by doing
    # python setup.py install
    # or
    # pip install eppy
    # or
    # easy_install eppy
    
    # if you have not done so, uncomment the following three lines
    import sys
    # pathnameto_eppy = 'c:/eppy'
    pathnameto_eppy = '../'
    sys.path.append(pathnameto_eppy)

.. code:: python

    from eppy.modeleditor import IDF
    
    iddfile = "/Applications/EnergyPlus-8-3-0/Energy+.idd"
    IDF.setiddname(iddfile)


.. code:: python

    idfname = "/Applications/EnergyPlus-8-3-0/ExampleFiles/BasicsFiles/Exercise1A.idf"
    epwfile = "/Applications/EnergyPlus-8-3-0/WeatherData/USA_IL_Chicago-OHare.Intl.AP.725300_TMY3.epw"
    
    idf = IDF(idfname, epwfile)
    idf.run()

if you are in a terminal, you will see something like this::

    Reporting Surfaces
    Beginning Primary Simulation
    Initializing New Environment Parameters

    EnergyPlus Run Time=00hr 00min  0.24sec


It’s as simple as that to run using the EnergyPlus defaults, but all the
EnergyPlus command line interface options are also supported.

To get a description of the options available, as well as the defaults
you can call the Python built-in help function on the IDF.run method and
it will print a full description of the options to the console.

.. code:: python

    help(idf.run)


.. parsed-literal::

            ep_version: str
                EnergyPlus version, used to find install directory. Required if run() is

Running in parallel processes
-----------------------------

One of the great things about Eppy is that it allows you to set up a lot
of jobs really easily. However, it can be slow running a lot of
EnergyPlus simulations, so it’s pretty important that we can make the
most of the processing power you have available by running on multiple
CPUs.

Again this is as simple as you’d hope it would be.

You first need to create your jobs as a list of lists in the form::

    
    [[<IDF object>, <dict of command line parameters>], ...]

The example here just creates 4 identical jobs apart from the
output\_directory the results are saved in, but you would obviously want
to make each job different.

Then run the jobs on the required number of CPUs using runIDFs...

... and your results will all be in the output\_directory you specified.
