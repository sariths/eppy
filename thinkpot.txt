You put ideas in a pot and let them simmer with the other ideas. New ideas may get cooked up.

----------

- add a field IDF.idd_index We already have IDF.idd_info
OR / AND
- embed the index within IDF.idd_info

    ----------
    elaborating further:
    - idd_info can point to data snippets within idd_index.
    - So the index is accesible from idd_info or idd_index
    - this can give some flexibility in future coding.

construction and materials
- use EpBunch.get_referenced_object to get the MaterialName in a construction
- We need a way to copy a construction from one idf to another.
    - This will have to copy the referenced layers too.
    - will there be duplicates in the copied-to file
    - how do copy file->file in eppy. I think this has been implemented
- Need a way to insert, delete, add and move layers in construction
    - this is moving repeatable fields
    - this may be needed in other objects too. 

- write function get_referable_objects
    this is what you see when you click on the edit box in "IDF Editor" that comes with E+
